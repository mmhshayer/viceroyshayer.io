#Introduction

There is so much negetivity, fear, disapointment related with death that its hard to see it for what it actually is.
Thousands of generation from Adam, yet death still haunts us. Still we are surprised when we come across it. Our attitude towards it unsurprisingly reveals deep wisdom on the collective unconciousness. It reflects how as species we never learn form our history, reflection, obvious yet everyone tried to change thw world to something better, better in their view.

Death is older then humans. It is as old as life itself. It is of a family of things, concepts, names that are commonly associated with end of things. Plastics are destroyed, Humans die, plants decay.

But it is more then that. Death is also associated with end of cycle, beginnings, change, metamorphosis thus it can be also associated with fear of change, holding on, stagnation.

Stagnation, the idea that deserves a good deal of personal thought. It is the true death in essence. It is what we fear about death, the thing about death we are not aware of or in my opinion, frightened and traumatized to think through.

The doubt about 'life after death' is merely an evolved and metaphoriszed way of asking if we will be experiancing stagnation after death. Will we be boulders on the mountain, rocks on sea bed. There but not there at all. The question reflects our deep insecurity arose by not living respectfully in the material world. You would not mind to be a butterfly if you do not judge it to be dumb, inferior. And to part in death means to accept that material world. And before we can accept it, we have to resolve our issues with it, face our guilt, pride, fear. And these are best resolved earlier in life. Before we dive in to higher concepts of judgemetn day, hell and heaven sink in to our conciousness and appears recurringly in everyday life.

Let us not confuse death with any other unrealized concepts.
