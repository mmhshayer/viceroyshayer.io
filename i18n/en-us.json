I have been developing professionally for 1.5 years but tinkering since 2016. I started in tech with internships, freelance services and part time positions during college. I have a bit off a diverse job history. I have had positions in help desk, graphic/web design, web app development and sysadmin/devops. I can help everywhere in the stack and I love wearing multiple hats to an extent. Although, I do think my most strongest skills are in Frontend Development.",
